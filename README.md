- Hi, I’m @CreateZone1
- I’m interested in make games for every OS, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, Apple, etc
- I’m currently learning python, so I make simples games with pygame, turtle, tkinter, ursina, etc, maybe be 2d and 3d games
- Because I'm from Argentina, I dont know speak English decently, sorry
- This is my first time using Github, honestly, I don't understand nothing
- Wish me luck!
